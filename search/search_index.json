You can add logic for success or failure based on your game's needs.

It sends back the Steam ID of the client that provided the auth ticket for validation, the result of the validation (success is 0, failure is anything else), and finally the Steam ID that owns the game.  As Valve notes, this may be different if the game is borrowed from Steam Family Share.  Inside this function, you can again put in whatever logic your game requires.

For this we'll create a _validate_Auth_Session() function:</p> <pre><code>func _validate_Auth_Session(ticket: Dictionary, steam_id: int) -&gt; void:\n    var RESPONSE: int = Steam.beginAuthSession(ticket['buffer'], ticket['size'], steam_id)\n\n    # Get a verbose response; unnecessary but useful in this example\n    var VERBOSE_RESPONSE: String\n    match RESPONSE:\n        0: VERBOSE_RESPONSE = \"Ticket is valid for this game and this Steam ID.\"\n        1: VERBOSE_RESPONSE = \"The ticket is invalid.\"\n        2: VERBOSE_RESPONSE = \"A ticket has already been submitted for this Steam ID.\"\n        3: VERBOSE_RESPONSE = \"Ticket is from an incompatible interface version.\"\n        4: VERBOSE_RESPONSE = \"Ticket is not for this game.\"\n        5: VERBOSE_RESPONSE = \"Ticket has expired.\"\n    print(\"Auth verifcation response: \"+str(VERBOSE_RESPONSE))\n\n    if RESPONSE == 0:\n        print(\"Validation successful, adding user to CLIENT_TICKETS\")\n        CLIENT_TICKETS.append({\"id\": steam_id, ticket\": ticket['id']} )\n\n    # You can now add the client to the game\n</code></pre> <p>If the response is 0, you can allow the player to connect to the server or game.  A callback will also be received and trigger our _validate_Auth_Ticket_Response() function; which, as we saw before, sends along the Steam ID of the auth ticket provider, the result, and owner of the game.  This callback will also be triggered when the client cancels or ends the auth session.</p> <p>After the ticket is validated, you'll want to save the player's Steam ID and their ticket handle in your CLIENT_TICKETS array either as an array or dictionary so they can be called later to cancel the auth sessions.

Additionally, if the game session is over, the server or other clients can call endAuthSession() to also close out the auth session:</p> <pre><code>Steam.endAuthSession(steam_id)\n</code></pre> <p>They will need to pass the Steam ID of every client connected.

First, you'll need to pass your leaderboard's Steamworks back-end name to the findLeaderboard() function like so:</p> <pre><code>Steam.findLeaderboard( your_leaderboard_name )\n</code></pre> <p>Once Steam finds your leaderboard it will pass back the handle to the leaderboard_find_result callback.  The _leaderboard_Find_Result() function that it is connected to it should look something like this:</p> <pre><code>func _leaderboard_Find_Result(handle: int, found: int) -&gt; void:\n    if found == 1:\n        LEADERBOARD_HANDLE = handle\n        print(\"Leaderboard handle found: \"+str(LEADERBOARD_HANDLE))\n    else:\n    print(\"No handle was found\")\n</code></pre> <p>Once you have this handle you can use all the additional functions.  Please note you do not need to save the leaderboard handle since it is stored internally.  However, you will only be able to work with one leaderboard at a time unless you store them locally in a variable. I would keep a dictionary of handles locally like:</p> <pre><code>var LEADERBOARD_HANDLES: Dictionary = {\n    \"top_score\": handle1,\n    \"most_kills\": handle2,\n    \"most_games\": handlde3\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This way you can call whatever handle you need when updating leaderboards quickly. Otherwise you have to query each leaderboard again with findLeaderboard() then wait for the callback then upload the new score.  If you aren't updating leaderboards frequently or that many of them, then using the internally stored handle will probably work fine.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/leaderboards/#uploading-scores","title":"Uploading Scores","text":"<p>Before we can download scores, we need to upload them.  The function itself is pretty simple:</p> <pre><code>Steam.uploadLeaderboardScore( score, keep_best, details, handle )\n</code></pre> <p>The first argument is, obviously, the score. The second is if you want the score to update regardless of whether it is better than the current score for the user. The third are details which must be integers; they essentially can be anything but here is what Valve says about it.  The fourth is the leaderboard handle we are updating.  You do not have to pass the handle though, if you want to use the internally stored one. Once you pass a score to Steam, you should receive a callback from leaderboard_score_uploaded.  This will trigger our _leaderboard_Score_Uploaded() function:</p> <pre><code>func _leaderboard_Score_Uploaded(success: int, score: int, score_changed: int, new_rank: int, prev_rank:int) -&gt; void:\n    if success == 1:\n        print(\"Successfully uploaded scores!\")\n        # Add additional logic to use other variables passed back\n    else:\n        print(\"Failed to upload scores!\")\n</code></pre> <p>For the most part you are just looking for a success of 1 to tell that it worked.  However, you may with to use the additional variables passed back by the signal for logic in your game:</p> <ul> <li>score: the new score as it stands</li> <li>score_changed: if the score was changed (0 if false, 1 if true)</li> <li>new_rank: the new global rank of this player</li> <li>prev_rank: the previous rank of this player</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorials/leaderboards/#downloading-scores","title":"Downloading Scores","text":"<p>Naturally you'll want to display leaderboard scores to the player.

If you do not save any details with the scores you can safely ignore this part and move on to just requesting leaderboard entries.</p> <p>In most cases you'll want to use downloadLeaderboardEntries(), but you can also use downloadLeaderboardEntriesForUsers() by passing an array of users' Steam IDs to it.  Both will respond with the same callback, but downloadLeaderboardEntriesForUsers() does not allow as much control over what you can request:</p> <pre><code>Steam.downloadLeaderboardEntries( 1, 10, 0, leaderboard_handle )\n\nSteam.downloadLeaderboardEntriesForUsers( user_array, leaderboard_handle )\n</code></pre> <p>Just like uploading, downloading scores does not require a leaderboard handle to be included if you are using the internally stored one.  You will noticed, as I mentioned above, that downloadLeaderboardEntriesForUsers() only takes an array of users' Steam IDs as it's other argument whereas downloadLeaderboardEntries() has quite a few others; which we will cover right now.</p> <p>The first argument the index of entries you are starting with; this is usually 1 for your first request. The second argument is the last index to retrieve; there isn't a listed cap to this number but make it something you can display easily like 10 or so.  The third argument is the type of data request; you can read more details about it in the SDK documentation. For a quick overview:</p> <ul> <li>0 - Used for a sequential range by leaderboard rank.</li> <li>1 - Used to get entries relative to the user's entry. You may want to use negatives for the start to get entries before the user's.</li> <li>2 - Used to get all entries for friends for the current user. Start and end arguments are ignored.</li> <li>3 - Used internally by Steam, do not use this.</li> </ul> <p>After you request leaderboard entries, you should receive a leaderboard_scores_downloaded callback which will trigger our _leaderboard_Scores_Downloaded() function.  That function should look similar to this:</p> <pre><code>func _leaderboard_Scores_Downloaded(message: string, result: Array) -&gt; void:\n    print(\"Scores downloaded message: \"+str(message)\n\n    # Add logic to display results\n    for R in result:\n        # Use each entry that is returned\n</code></pre> <p>The message is just a basic message to inform you to the status the download; whether successful or not and why. The second piece sent back are the results as an array. Each entry in the array is actually a dictionary like so:</p> <ul> <li>score: this user's score</li> <li>steamID: this user's Steam ID; you can use this to get their avatar, name, etc.</li> <li>global_rank: obviously their global ranking for this leaderboard</li> <li>ugc_handle: handle for any UGC that is attached to this entry</li> <li>details: any details you stored with this entry for later use</li> </ul> <p>I will add more to this tutorial at a later date with other functions but this should cover all the basics for working with leaderboards.</p> <p>To see this tutorial in action, check out the example branch on the GodotSteam Github repo.

The most important will be the LOBBY_ID, which obviously houses the lobby's ID, and LOBBY_MEMBERS, which will be an array of dictionaries of lobby members and their Steam ID 64's. LOBBY_INVITE_ARG is mostly used when the game is started by accepting a Steam invite or joining a game from your friends list if the game isn't running.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/lobbies_p2p/#the-_ready-function","title":"The _ready() Function","text":"<p>Next we'll want to set up the signal connections for Steamworks and a command line checker like so:</p> <pre><code>func _ready() -&gt; void:\n    Steam.connect(\"lobby_created\", self, \"_on_Lobby_Created\")\n    Steam.connect(\"lobby_match_list\", self, \"_on_Lobby_Match_List\")\n    Steam.connect(\"lobby_joined\", self, \"_on_Lobby_Joined\")\n    Steam.connect(\"lobby_chat_update\", self, \"_on_Lobby_Chat_Update\")\n    Steam.connect(\"lobby_message\", self, \"_on_Lobby_Message\")\n    Steam.connect(\"lobby_data_update\", self, \"_on_Lobby_Data_Update\")\n    Steam.connect(\"lobby_invite\", self, \"_on_Lobby_Invite\")\n    Steam.connect(\"join_requested\", self, \"_on_Lobby_Join_Requested\")\n    Steam.connect(\"persona_state_change\", self, \"_on_Persona_Change\")\n    Steam.connect(\"p2p_session_request\", self, \"_on_P2P_Session_Request\")\n    Steam.connect(\"p2p_session_connect_fail\", self, \"_on_P2P_Session_Connect_Fail\")\n\n    # Check for command line arguments\n    _check_Command_Line()\n</code></pre> <p>We will get into each of these below. You noticed we added a check for command line arguments. Here is how our basic function will look:</p> <pre><code>func _check_Command_Line() -&gt; void:\n    var ARGUMENTS: Array = OS.get_cmdline_args()\n\n    # There are arguments to process\n    if ARGUMENTS.size() &gt; 0:\n\n        # A Steam connection argument exists\n        if ARGUMENT[0] == \"+connect_lobby\":\n\n            # Lobby invite exists so try to connect to it\n            if int(ARGUMENTS[1]) &gt; 0:\n\n                # At this point, you'll probably want to change scenes\n                # Something like a loading into lobby screen\n                print(\"CMD Line Lobby ID: \"+str(ARGUMENTS[1]))\n                _join_Lobby(int(ARGUMENTS[1]))\n</code></pre> <p>This is important if the player is accepting a Steam invite or right-clicks a friend's name then selects 'Join Game' or 'Join Lobby' and doesn't have the game open. Doing either action will launch the game with the additional command <code>+connect_lobby &lt;Steam Lobby ID&gt;</code>. Sadly Godot doesn't really understand this command argument so our _check_Command_Line() function has to be written to work within those constraints.</p> <p>Additionally, you'll need to add the appropriate scene name to your Steamworks launch options on the Steamworks website. You'll want to add the full scene path (res://your-scene.tscn) on the Arguments line in your launch option. You can read more about that, with details, in this link.

You'll probably want to connect this function to a button somewhere in your game:</p> <pre><code>func _create_Lobby() -&gt; void:\n    # Make sure a lobby is not already set\n    if LOBBY_ID == 0:\n        Steam.createLobby(LOBBY_AVAILABILITY.PUBLIC, LOBBY_MAX_MEMBERS)\n</code></pre> <p>In this example we have createLobby() using our variables and enum.  The first variables covers the type of lobby; we are using a public lobby open to all.  There are, of course, four settings in total you can use:</p> <ul> <li>0 - Private - The only way to join the lobby is from an invite.</li> <li>1 - Friends only - Joinable by friends and invitees, but does not show up in the lobby list.</li> <li>2 - Public - Returned by search and visible to friends.</li> <li>3 - Invisible - Returned by search, but not visible to other friends.</li> </ul> <p>The second variable is the maximum number of players allowed to join the lobby. This cannot be set higher than 250. Next we'll cover the callback from Steam saying the lobby has been created:</p> <pre><code>func _on_Lobby_Created(connect: int, lobby_id: int) -&gt; void:\n    if connect == 1:\n        # Set the lobby ID\n        LOBBY_ID = lobby_id\n        print(\"Created a lobby: \"+str(LOBBY_ID))\n\n        # Set this lobby as joinable, just in case, though this should be done by default\n        Steam.setLobbyJoinable(LOBBY_ID, true)\n\n        # Set some lobby data\n        Steam.setLobbyData(lobby_id, \"name\", \"Gramps' Lobby\")\n        Steam.setLobbyData(lobby_id, \"mode\", \"GodotSteam test\")\n\n        # Allow P2P connections to fallback to being relayed through Steam if needed\n        var RELAY: bool = Steam.allowP2PPacketRelay(true)\n        print(\"Allowing Steam to be relay backup: \"+str(RELAY))\n</code></pre> <p>Once this callback fires, you'll have your lobby ID which you can pass off to our LOBBY_ID variable for later use.  As the note says, the lobby should be set to joinable by default but, just in case, we add it here.  You can make the lobby unjoinable too. You can also se some lobby data now; which can be whatever key / value pair you want.  I'm not aware of a maximum amount of pairs you can set. And you'll notice I set allowP2PPacketRelay() to true at this point; this allows, as the note mentions, P2P connections to fallback to being relayed through Steam if needed.  This usually happens if you have NAT or firewall issues.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/lobbies_p2p/#get-lobby-lists","title":"Get Lobby Lists","text":"<p>Now that we can create lobbies, let's query and pull a list of lobbies.  I usually have a button that will open a lobby interface which is a list of buttons, one per lobby:</p> <pre><code>func _on_Open_Lobby_List_pressed() -&gt; void:\n    # Set distance to worldwide\n    Steam.addRequestLobbyListDistanceFilter(3)\n\n    print(\"Requesting a lobby list\")\n    Steam.requestLobbyList()\n</code></pre> <p>Before requesting the lobby list with requestLobbyList() you can add more search queries like:</p> <ul> <li>addRequestLobbyListStringFilter - which allows you to look for specific works in the lobby metadata</li> <li>addRequestLobbyListNumericalFilter - which adds a numerical comparions filter (&lt;=, &lt;, =, &gt;, &gt;=, !=)</li> <li>addRequestLobbyListNearValueFilter - which gives results closes to the specified value you give</li> <li>addRequestLobbyListFilterSlotsAvailable - which only returns lobbies with a specified amount of open slots available</li> <li>addRequestLobbyListResultCountFilter - which sets how many results you want returned</li> <li>addRequestLobbyListDistanceFilter - which sets the distance to search for lobbies, like:<ul> <li>0 - Close</li> <li>1 - Default</li> <li>2 - Far</li> <li>3 - Worldwide</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Once you set all or none of these, you can then call requestLobbyList(). Once it pulls your lobby list it will fire a callback _on_Lobby_Match_List(). You can then loop through the lobbies however you want. In our example code, I do something like this to make buttons for each lobby:</p> <pre><code>func _on_Lobby_Match_List(lobbies: Array) -&gt; void:\n    for LOBBY in lobbies:\n        # Pull lobby data from Steam, these are specific to our example\n        var LOBBY_NAME: String = Steam.getLobbyData(LOBBY, \"name\")\n        var LOBBY_MODE: String = Steam.getLobbyData(LOBBY, \"mode\")\n\n        # Get the current number of members\n        var LOBBY_NUM_MEMBERS: int = Steam.getNumLobbyMembers(LOBBY)\n\n        # Create a button for the lobby\n        var LOBBY_BUTTON: Button = Button.new()\n        LOBBY_BUTTON.set_text(\"Lobby \", LOBBY, \": \", LOBBY_NAME, \" [\", LOBBY_MODE, \"] - \", LOBBY_NUM_MEMBERS, \" Player(s)\")\n        LOBBY_BUTTON.set_size(Vector2(800, 50))\n        LOBBY_BUTTON.set_name(\"lobby_\"+str(LOBBY))\n        LOBBY_BUTTON.connect(\"pressed\", self, \"_join_Lobby\", [LOBBY])\n\n        # Add the new lobby to the list\n        $\"Lobby Panel/Panel/Scroll/VBox\".add_child(LOBBY_BUTTON)\n</code></pre> <p>You should now have a way to call lobby lists and display them.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/lobbies_p2p/#joining-lobbies","title":"Joining Lobbies","text":"<p>Next we'll tackle joining a lobby.

Each packet will go through the following function:</p> <pre><code>func _send_P2P_Packet(target: int, packet_data: Dictionary) -&gt; void:\n    # Set the send_type and channel\n    var SEND_TYPE: int = Steam.P2P_SEND_RELIABLE\n    var CHANNEL: int = 0\n\n    # Create a data array to send the data through\n    var DATA: PoolByteArray\n    DATA.append_array(var2bytes(packet_data))\n\n    # If sending a packet to everyone\n    if target == 0:\n        # If there is more than one user, send packets\n        if LOBBY_MEMBERS.size() &gt; 1:\n            # Loop through all members that aren't you\n            for MEMBER in LOBBY_MEMBERS:\n                if MEMBER['steam_id'] != STEAM_ID:\n                    Steam.sendP2PPacket(MEMBER['steam_id'], DATA, SEND_TYPE, CHANNEL)\n    # Else send it to someone specific\n    else:\n        Steam.sendP2PPacket(target, DATA, SEND_TYPE, CHANNEL)\n</code></pre> <p>The send_type variable will corresponed to these integers:</p> <ul> <li>0 - Send unreliable</li> <li>1 - Send unreliable with no delay</li> <li>2 - Send reliable</li> <li>3 - Send reliable with buffering</li> </ul> <p>The channel used should match for both read and send functions. You may want to use multiple channels so this should obviously be adjusted.</p> <p>As your game increases in complexity, you may find the amount of data you're sending increases significantly. One of the core tenets of responsive, effective networking is reducing the amount of data you're sending, to reduce the chance of some part becoming corrupted or requiring players of your game to have a very fast internet connection to even play your game. Luckily, we can introduce compression to our send function to shrink the size of the data without needing to change our whole dictionary. The concept is straightforward enough; when we call the var2bytes function, we turn our dictionary (or some other variable) into a PoolByteArray and send it over the internet. We can compress the PoolByteArray to be smaller with a single line of code:</p> <pre><code>func _send_P2P_Packet(target: int, packet_data: Dictionary) -&gt; void:\n    # Set the send_type and channel\n    var SEND_TYPE: int = Steam.P2P_SEND_RELIABLE\n    var CHANNEL: int = 0\n\n    # Create a data array to send the data through\n    var DATA: PoolByteArray\n    # Compress the PoolByteArray we create from our dictionary  using the GZIP compression method\n    var COMPRESSED_DATA: PoolByteArray = var2bytes(packet_data).compress(File.COMPRESSION_GZIP)\n    DATA.append_array(COMPRESSED_DATA)\n\n    # If sending a packet to everyone\n    if target == 0:\n        # If there is more than one user, send packets\n        if LOBBY_MEMBERS.size() &gt; 1:\n            # Loop through all members that aren't you\n            for MEMBER in LOBBY_MEMBERS:\n                if MEMBER['steam_id'] != STEAM_ID:\n                    Steam.sendP2PPacket(MEMBER['steam_id'], DATA, SEND_TYPE, CHANNEL)\n    # Else send it to someone specific\n    else:\n        Steam.sendP2PPacket(target, DATA, SEND_TYPE, CHANNEL)\n</code></pre> <p>Of course, we've now sent a compressed PoolByteArray to someone else over the internet, so when they receive the packet, they will need to first decompress the PoolByteArray before they can decode it.         To accomplish this, we add a single line of code to our _read_P2P_Packet function like so: <pre><code>func _read_P2P_Packet() -&gt; void:\n    var PACKET_SIZE: int = Steam.getAvailableP2PPacketSize(0)\n\n    # There is a packet\n    if PACKET_SIZE &gt; 0:\n        var PACKET: Dictionary = Steam.readP2PPacket(PACKET_SIZE, 0)\n\n        if PACKET.empty() or PACKET == null:\n            print(\"WARNING: read an empty packet with non-zero size!\")\n\n        # Get the remote user's ID\n        var PACKET_SENDER: int = PACKET['steam_id_remote']\n\n        # Make the packet data readable\n        var PACKET_CODE: PoolByteArray = PACKET['data']\n        # Decompress the array before turning it into a useable dictionary\n        var READABLE: Dictionary = bytes2var(PACKET_CODE.decompress_dynamic(-1, File.COMPRESSION_GZIP))\n\n        # Print the packet to output\n        print(\"Packet: \"+str(READABLE))\n\n        # Append logic here to deal with packet data\n</code></pre></p> <p>The key point to note here is the format must be the same for sending and receiving. There's a whole lot to read about compression in Godot, far beyond this tutorial; to learn more, read all about it here.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/lobbies_p2p/#p2p-session-failures","title":"P2P Session Failures","text":"<p>For the last part of this tutorial we'll handle P2P failures with the following function which is triggered by the p2p_session_connect_fail callback:</p> <pre><code>func _on_P2P_Session_Connect_Fail(steamID: int, session_error: int) -&gt; void:\n    # If no error was given\n    if session_error == 0:\n        print(\"WARNING: Session failure with \"+str(steamID)+\" [no error given].\")\n\n    # Else if target user was not running the same game\n    elif session_error == 1:\n        print(\"WARNING: Session failure with \"+str(steamID)+\" [target user not running the same game].\")\n\n    # Else if local user doesn't own app / game\n    elif session_error == 2:\n        print(\"WARNING: Session failure with \"+str(steamID)+\" [local user doesn't own app / game].\")\n\n    # Else if target user isn't connected to Steam\n    elif session_error == 3:\n        print(\"WARNING: Session failure with \"+str(steamID)+\" [target user isn't connected to Steam].\")\n\n    # Else if connection timed out\n    elif session_error == 4:\n        print(\"WARNING: Session failure with \"+str(steamID)+\" [connection timed out].\")\n\n    # Else if unused\n    elif session_error == 5:\n        print(\"WARNING: Session failure with \"+str(steamID)+\" [unused].\")\n\n    # Else no known error\n    else:\n        print(\"WARNING: Session failure with \"+str(steamID)+\" [unknown error \"+str(session_error)+\"].\")\n</code></pre> <p>This will print a warning message so you know why the session connection failed.

There are a few ways to handle connecting the callback for statistics / achievements data received from Steam's servers. Unless you choose to turn it off by passing false to the steamInit() function; it will automatically request the local user's current statistics and achievements.  I generally pass false to prevent this.</p> <p>To retrieve the data from the resulting callback, you need to connect the current_stats_receivedcallback to a function like so:</p> <pre><code>Steam.connect(\"current_stats_received\", self, \"_steam_Stats_Ready\", [], CONNECT_ONESHOT)\n</code></pre> <p>You'll notice that CONNECT_ONESHOT is passed along to prevent this from firing more than once.  This is because that signal is sent any time stats are updated or received and will run the _steam_Stats_Ready() again.  In my use-cases this is not desirable, but it may be in yours. If you don't mind the _steam_Stats_Ready() firing each time, depending on your function's logic, feel free to omit that part like so:</p> <pre><code>Steam.connect(\"current_stats_received\", self, \"_steam_Stats_Ready\")\n</code></pre> <p>If you do keep the CONNECT_ONESHOTas I do, I suggest calling for Steam stat updates with requestUserStats()and pass with it the user's Steam ID.  This function will work with any user: local or remote. You'll also want to connect it's signal in a similar manner:</p> <pre><code>Steam.connect(\"user_stats_received\", self, \"_steam_Stats_Ready\")\n</code></pre> <p>It can be connected to the same function as requestCurrentStats() as they send the same data back.  For our example, here is the _steam_Stats_Ready() function we listed in the connected signals:</p> <pre><code>func _steam_Stats_Ready(game: int, result: int, user: int) -&gt; void:\n    print(\"This game's ID: \"+str(game))\n    print(\"Call result: \"+str(result))\n    print(\"This user's Steam ID: \"+str(user))\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tutorials/stats_achievements/#working-with-the-data","title":"Working With The Data","text":"<p>In this function you can check if the result is what you expect (ideally it is 1), see if the given stats are for the current player, and check that the game's ID matches.
